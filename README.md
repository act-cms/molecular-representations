# Bridging Basic Chemistry and Cheminformatics: Jupyter-based Modules on Molecular Representation for Introductory Chemistry

**Author:** Kevin P. Greenman, Ph.D. (MolSSI ACT-CMS Faculty Fellow 2024-2026)

## Learning Objectives

### Chemistry

* Identify and differentiate between ionic and covalent bonds based on electronegativity differences and electron transfer/sharing mechanisms.
* Predict the molecular geometry of simple molecules using VSEPR theory.
* Describe hybridisation and determine sp, sp², sp³, sp³d, and sp³d² states.

### Cyber-infrastructure

* Read and write chemical data as SMILES + property values from CSV using pandas.
* Clean and visualise chemical datasets using pandas, RDKit, and other Python operations.
* Use Colab GPU resources to train a basic Chemprop (graph neural-network) model.
* Visualise ML regression results with matplotlib.

### Integrated

* Translate between chemical representations (formula, SMILES, graph, geometry, conformers).
* Choose the appropriate representation for a given task and justify the choice.
